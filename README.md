# **ELK Stack with Docker Compose**

This project provides a streamlined setup of the **ELK Stack** using Docker Compose, enabling quick and efficient deployment of Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, Filebeat, and Metricbeat.

## **Overview**

### **Elasticsearch**
Elasticsearch is the core of the ELK Stack, a powerful search and analytics engine. It stores and indexes data, allowing for fast and scalable searching. In this setup, Elasticsearch operates as a single-node cluster, making it ideal for development and testing.

### **Kibana**
Kibana is the visualization layer of the stack. It provides a user-friendly interface to search, analyze, and visualize data stored in Elasticsearch. Kibana is essential for monitoring and managing the Elasticsearch cluster, as well as for creating dashboards and visualizations.

### **Logstash**
Logstash is a data processing pipeline that ingests data from various sources, transforms it, and then sends it to Elasticsearch for indexing. In this setup, Logstash is configured to work with both Filebeat and Metricbeat, handling logs and metrics data efficiently.

### **Filebeat**
Filebeat is a lightweight log shipper that monitors and forwards log data to Logstash for processing. It is designed to be fast and efficient, ensuring that logs from various sources are centralized and processed in real-time.

### **Metricbeat**
Metricbeat is a lightweight shipper designed to collect and ship system and service metrics. It provides insights into the performance of the system and services, allowing for better monitoring and optimization.

### **Use Cases**

Development & Testing: Quickly spin up an ELK Stack for developing and testing applications.
Monitoring & Analytics: Use the stack to monitor logs and metrics from various sources, enabling better decision-making based on real-time data.
Data Exploration: Analyze and visualize large datasets, gaining insights into trends, anomalies, and other critical metrics.
This setup provides a robust foundation for working with the ELK Stack, making it easier to manage and analyze your data.

## **Getting Started**

This setup is ready to use with Docker Compose. Simply clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, and run the following command to start all services:

```bash
./system-up

Once the services are up and running, you can access Kibana by navigating to http://localhost:5601 in your web browser.
From there, you can start exploring your data, creating visualizations, and monitoring the health of your Elasticsearch cluster.
